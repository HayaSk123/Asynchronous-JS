# Asynchronous-JS
This repository contains my practice work on asynchronous programming concepts in JavaScript, specifically focusing on callback functions. The repository includes a file named callback.ts where I've implemented various examples demonstrating the use of callback functions.

Contents:
Simple Greeting Function:
A function that accepts a name and a callback function to greet the person.
Addition Function:
A function that takes two numbers and a callback function to add the numbers and return the result.
Array Element Doubling:
A function that takes an array of numbers and a callback function to double each number in the array.
String Transformation:
A function that takes a string and a callback function to transform the string to uppercase.
